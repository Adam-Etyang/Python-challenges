# Priority Queues
A priority queue is a data structure for maintaining a set S of elements, each with an associated value called a key ~ from CLRS.
A priority queue is an abstract data type like a queue but instead of elements coming out in the order they were added (FIFO) the come iut by priority.
Just like heaps there are two types:
- Max priority queue, the highest priority elements is removed first
- Min priority queue, the lowest priority element is removed first.

Each can be built by their corresponding heaps
